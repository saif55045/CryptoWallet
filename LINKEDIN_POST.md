🚀 **Excited to share our latest Blockchain project!** 🚀

I'm thrilled to present our **Decentralized Cryptocurrency Wallet System** - a full-stack blockchain application built from scratch as part of our BSSE 7th Semester course.

🔐 **What we built:**
✅ Complete blockchain with Proof-of-Work mining
✅ UTXO transaction model (like Bitcoin)
✅ Merkle root verification for block integrity
✅ User authentication with JWT & Google OAuth
✅ Zakat calculation system
✅ Admin dashboard for system management
✅ Modern, responsive UI with React & Tailwind CSS

💻 **Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Go (Gin Framework)
- Frontend: React 19
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Deployment: Render + Vercel

🎯 **Key Features:**
- Multi-wallet support
- Real-time transaction processing
- Cryptographic security (bcrypt, RSA)
- Islamic finance integration (Zakat)
- Complete admin panel

Couldn't have done this without my amazing partner **Ahtasham** - great teamwork makes the dream work! 🤝
